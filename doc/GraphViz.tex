For graphical visualisation of relations we use the graphic
visualisation tool {\em dot} \cite{KouNor:dgwd}.

The following function uses a string as glue between a list of 
strings, to produce a single long string. 

\bc\begin{verbatim} 
glueWith :: String -> [String] -> String
glueWith _ []     = []
glueWith _ [y]    = y
glueWith s (y:ys) = y ++ s ++ glueWith s ys
\end{verbatim}\ec

The \verb^graphviz^ function maps a relation with showable 
components to a string that can be processed by {\em dot}. 

\bc\begin{verbatim} 
graphviz :: (Ord a, Show a, Ord b, Show b) => Rl a b -> String
graphviz rel = 
  let 
    (Set xs) = edges rel 
  in 
   "digraph G { " 
      ++
    glueWith " ; " [ (show x) ++ " -> " ++ (show y) | (x,y) <- xs ]
      ++ " }"
\end{verbatim}\ec

Writing a graphical representation of a relation to a file:  

\bc\begin{verbatim}
writeRel :: (Ord a, Show a, Ord b, Show b) => String -> Rl a b -> IO()
writeRel name r = writeFile (name ++ ".dot") (graphviz r)
\end{verbatim}\ec
